                I am currently residing in Nashville, TN with my husband, Justin. He works as a biostatistician 
                at a large healthcare company. I am originally from Miami, FL. I would not have pictured ever living 
                in Nashville, but this city as grown on me year after year and would recommend it for anyone who is a 
                music and outdoor lover!
